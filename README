This is stuff. Some of it does things.

 hello_elf_amd64_linux/
   - Experiement to see how small a proper hello world can be in a binary
     that runs on linux amd64 (ELF). 112 bytes. Considering that you need
     120 bytes of headers for an ELF binary with one load section, I'd say
     it can't be reduced anymore.

 avl/
   - Ted Unangst wrote an avl tree implementation that never got used for
     whatever he wrote it for. I beat it up to make it smaller and faster
     and added an iterator to it.

 heap/
   - Binary heap with in-struct linkage along the same principles as
     sys/tree.h in OpenBSD.
