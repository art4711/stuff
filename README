This is stuff. It does things.

 hello_elf_amd64_linux/
   - Experiement to see how small a proper hello world can be in a binary
     that runs on linux amd64 (ELF). 112 bytes. Considering that you need
     120 bytes of headers for an ELF binary with one load section, I'd say
     it can't be reduced anymore.
