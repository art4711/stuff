This is stuff. Some of it does things.

 avl/
   - Ted Unangst wrote an avl tree implementation that never got used for
     whatever he wrote it for. I beat it up to make it smaller and faster
     and added an iterator to it.

 heap/
   - Binary heap with in-struct linkage along the same principles as
     sys/tree.h in OpenBSD.

 hello_elf_amd64_linux/
   - Experiement to see how small a proper hello world can be in a binary
     that runs on linux amd64 (ELF). 112 bytes. Considering that you need
     120 bytes of headers for an ELF binary with one load section, I'd say
     it can't be reduced anymore.

 lock_recursion_is_bad/
   - Favourite example for why lazily making your locks recursive is a
     bad idea. This is a bug that was present in many unix-like systems
     many years ago that made the filesystem leak uninitialized data.
     At the moment of writing this it will deadlock the process on
     macos and after a reboot the file will contain stuff from
     uninitialized memory (technically it contains unitialized memory
     before the reboot, but I haven't found a way to read it without
     deadlocking).
